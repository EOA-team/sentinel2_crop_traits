The data in this repository is the result of labor-intensive work in the field and laboratory by many people
including field and laboratory technicians, student assistants, PhD students and senior scientists. We make
the data public because we believe in the power of sharing and open-source.

Still, we also need to get acknowledgement and proper credit for our work. So, whenever you use the data or
parts of it please

* cite our paper (see [top-level README file](../README.md))
* star our repository on GitHub and fork it if you use the data on your own

If your work relies substantially on our data please also [get in touch with us](https://www.eoa-team.net/) and consider offering co-authorship.
